# Changelog

All notable changes to Hermey are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions are the app's build versions.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] — 2026-11-08

### Added
- `setup/install.sh`: one command installs a Hermey host — service user, venv, loopback bridge,
  `tailscale serve` for TLS, `hermey` CLI (status, pair, logs, doctor, update, uninstall), and an
  idempotent upgrade path. It reuses the Hermes dashboard already running on the host.
- `hermey pair` mints a fresh code, a `hermes://pair` deep link and a scannable QR.

### Fixed
- Group chat messages render as markdown (bold, lists, quotes, code, tables) at full width instead of
  raw source inside a narrow bubble.
- Scrolling a group chat dismisses the keyboard, as a one-to-one conversation does.
- A pairing code names the host the requesting client used instead of a fixed domain.

## 0.1.3 and earlier

Bot list home screen, endless conversations per bot, group chats with rename/delete from the row's
context menu, per-message read-aloud through the host voice, copy, reply and reactions, the composer
clear button, approvals, attachments, and the three-pane macOS shell.
